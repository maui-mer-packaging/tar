Name: tar
Summary: A GNU file archiving program
Description: |
  The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive. Tar
  can also be used to add supplemental files to an archive and to update
  or list files in the archive. Tar includes multivolume support,
  automatic archive compression/decompression, the ability to perform
  remote archives, and the ability to perform incremental and full
  backups.

  If you want to use tar for remote backups, you also need to install
  the rmt package.
